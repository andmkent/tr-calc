; Inequality Proving Library
;**********************************************************************
;
; This library aims to provide a sound algorithm for deciding
; if one system of linear inequalities over integers (P) implies
; another (Q) by assuming (P /\ ~Q) and testing for unsatisfiability.
;
; The transformations are based on the fourier-motzkin elimination method.
; Variables are eliminated until the system is trivial.
;
; Elimination is performed as follows:
;   1) partition the set of inequalities into those which can be 
;      written as a*x <= l, those which can be written as l <= a*x,
;      and those without x (where a is a positive coefficient and l
;      is a linear combination of variables and coefficients)
;   2) for each possible pairing l1 <= a1*x  and a2*x <= l2, we add
;      a2*l1 <= a1*l2 to the system and remove the equations with x
;      - now our system is larger and does not contain the variable x
;   3) this is repeated until the system can be trivially checked
;      to see if it is unsatisfiable
;
; Because this method is for linear inequalities with variables that range
; over reals (and not integers), it is a sound but incomplete model with 
; respect to testing for unsatisfiability
;
; All inequalities in this system are represented with <=
; For negation we utilize the equivalence ~(a <= b) <-> 1 + b <= a
; since we are concerned with integer solutions.
